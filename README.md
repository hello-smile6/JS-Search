# JS-Search
## A Search Engine That Utilizes JavaScript To Run, ideal for non-secure websites.
I recently created a JavaScript search engine. I was trying to design something that did not need PHP, as I could not run **anything** server-side. My project is at http://htmlcssjs.codehs.me/pages/search.html. I will be integrating it with GitHub in the next few weeks.
